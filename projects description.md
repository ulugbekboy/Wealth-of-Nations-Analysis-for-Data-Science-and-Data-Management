Python Exercise Classes

Evaluation Criteria

The project will be evaluated based on the following seven criteria. The total score is 33 points. Each component is designed to assess a key skill covered in the course.

1. GitHub Usage (5 points)
This criterion assesses your ability to use Git and GitHub for version control, a fundamental practice in modern software and data science development. The project should be hosted in a GitHub repository with: a clear and informative README.md file, explaining what the project is about, listing important information (e.g., data sources, libraries), and providing clear instructions on how to setup and run the code; a well-configured .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files; a meaningful commit history, with frequent and atomic commits, having descriptive messages.

2. Project Organization (5 points)
This criterion evaluates the structure and quality of your codebase. A well-organized project should: be logically organized into modules/scripts; have functions and classes with clear docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values; respect Python style guide, using consistent naming conventions, proper indentation, and clear variable names; provide a requirements.txt file, listing all the necessary Python libraries and their versions.

3. Input/Output (5 points)
This criterion assesses your ability to work with data from external sources. The project should successfully load data from at least one external source (e.g., CSV, JSON, Excel, a database, or an API). The chosen data source should be appropriate for the analytical goals of the project. The code should handle data loading cleanly, addressing possible errors. The project may also demonstrate output capabilities by saving or displaying results, such as a summary table or generated plots.

4. Data Manipulation (5 points)
This criterion focuses on the core task of handling data, evaluating your ability to use a data manipulation library like pandas to clean, transform, reshape, and prepare your data for the analysis and visualization stages.

5. Scientific Computing (5 points)
This criterion assesses your ability to perform numerical and statistical computations on your data, using libraries like numPy or sciPy to extract quantitative insights, perform calculations, and prepare data for more complex modeling.

6. Visualisation (5 points)
This criterion evaluates your ability to communicate your findings visually. This involves creating clear and informative plots that reveal patterns, trends, and insights using a visualisation library, such as matplotlib or seaborn.

7. BONUS: Web Application (3 points)
This optional criterion offers a chance to earn bonus points by making your project interactive and accessible. By wrapping your analysis in a simple web application, using a framework like streamlit, you could create a dynamic dashboard that allows users to explore your findings in an engaging way.


The Wealth of Nations
Dive into the intricate relationship between a country's economic prosperity and the well-being of its population. This project invites you to explore decades of global development data to uncover trends and correlations. You could analyze how indicators like GDP per capita relate to life expectancy, healthcare spending, or child mortality rates. Create compelling visualizations, such as time-series charts or global maps, to tell a story about global health and economics. The goal is to build an analytical project that reveals patterns in how nations thrive. Data for this project can be sourced directly from the World Bank Open Data portal or via its Python API.
