# Project Topic

# The Wealth of Nations. Dive into the intricate relationship between a country's economic prosperity and the well-being of its population. This project invites you to explore decades of global development data to uncover trends and correlations. You could analyze how indicators like GDP per capita relate to life expectancy, healthcare spending, or child mortality rates. Create compelling visualizations, such as time-series charts or global maps, to tell a story about global health and economics. The goal is to build an analytical project that reveals patterns in how nations thrive. Data for this project can be sourced directly from the World Bank Open Data portal or via its Python API. #
